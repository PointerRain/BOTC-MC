    "flavor": "Vibrant spring gives way to a warm and inviting summer. Flowers of every description blossom as far as the eye can see, tenderly nurtured in public gardens and window boxes overlooking the lavish promenade. Birds sing, artists paint, and philosophers ponder life's greatest mysteries inside a bustling tavern as a circus pitches its endearingly ragged tent on the edge of town.\nAs the townsfolk bask in frivolity and mischief, indulging themselves in fine entertainment and even finer wine, dark and clandestine forces are assembling. Witches and cults lurk in majestic ruins on the fringes of the community, hosting secret meetings in underground caves and malevolently plotting the downfall of Ravenswood Bluff and its revelers.\nThe time is ripe for... Sects & Violets.",
