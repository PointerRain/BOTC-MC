The feeble Emperor withers away to the North, having abandoned Rome: the heart of the empire since the very beginning. What once was an invincible hold on the world is now increasingly atrophied in the face of dissenters: incessantly encroaching from all directions. Rumours start to spread rapidly from Constantinople: A rebellion, lead by a Thracian Gladiator named Spartacus. A Barbaric invasion, the likes of which will test the mettle of the Romani Legionaries like never before.\nYet, worst of all: the Spirit of Rome's past Emperors and enemies are known to be spiteful and cruel. In its greatest hour of need, it has long been prophesied that one such leader would return to cast this city into ruin. The foundations of Rome are cracking, unveiling Bad Omens aplenty. In the absence of conventional leadership, it is now up to you, the loyal citizens of Rome, to prevent this city from collapsing and falling into disarray. Find the Spirit, that Daemonium, that Demon: whatever it takes, no matter the cost.\nShould you fail: this will surely cause the…\nFall Of Rome.",
